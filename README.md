## uorganisms

### Description
This genetics project was completed with the 6th grade science teachers to learn about how genetic traits are passed from generation to generation. Then, students used [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) to simulate reproduction of virtual organisms in a population over many generations. Although genetic traits are selected randomly, patterns and trends emerge due to a concept called [Genetic Drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift).

@KellyPared and @smtibor taught this lesson to all sixth grade students on the Fort Lauderdale campus.
