Here are some other things we've made over the past year at Pine Crest.

## uorganisms

### Description
This genetics project was completed with the 6th grade science teachers to learn about how genetic traits are passed from generation to generation. Then, students used Jupyter Notebooks to simulate reproduction of virtual organisms in a population over many generations. Although genetic traits are selected randomly, patterns and trends emerge due to a concept called Genetic Drift.

@KellyPared and I taught this lesson to all sixth grade students on the Fort Lauderdale campus.
