^Albert Samuel plays checkers against an IBM 701

^AI is not a new idea. The first AI research happened back in the early 20th century with neural networks

^Recent advances in computing power and neural network designs have lead to an explosion of interest in machine learning and deep learning

# Middle School Considerations

1. Students are developing rapidly
2. Cognitive capabilities are sufficient for advanced topics
3. Foundational knowledge may not be established

## Web-based Examples

- Quick Draw
- Google CoLab
- Google Image Classification
- TensorFlow Playground

![right](photos/quickdraw_data.png)

---

# Activities

- Train Google Quick Draw and race the clock
- Smallest Viable [Tensor Network](https://playground.tensorflow.org)
- Make [GAN Art](http://gandissect.res.ibm.com/ganpaint.html?project=churchoutdoor&layer=layer4)
- Write a [Chat Bot](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/building-a-simple-chatbot-in-python-using-nltk-7c8c8215ac6e)
- Create an [Alexa Skill](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/guides)

^ You can download the quick draw dataset
