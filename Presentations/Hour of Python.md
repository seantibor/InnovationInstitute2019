# How to Flash an External LED on a Microbit
## By Olivia M.

---

First, gather the materials. You will need:

- banana clip to alligator clip wire (x2)
- external LED
- Microbit
- Micro USB cord

# Instructions

---

## Code:
First, open Mu Editor and start a new code.  Then, type this code:

```python
from microbit import *

while True:
    pin0.write_digital(1)
    sleep(500)
    pin0.write_digital(0)
    sleep(500)
```

---

Line 1: importing microbit library into the code
Line 3: starting a forever loop (making the code under run forever)
Line 4: pin0 (0 hole on microbit) blinking for 1 second
Line 5/7: stopping pin0 for 500 milliseconds
Line 6: turning pin0 off (allowing it to blink)

---

## Building the Microbit Part:

1. Plug in micro USB cord into the USB in your computer
1. Plug the Micro USB end into the Microbit
1. Plug the banana clip ends of the alligator to banana clip cords into the 0 and GND holes in the microbit
1. Attach the alligator ends of the alligator to banana clip cords to the 2 metal ends of the external LED (one alligator clip on each wire end) 
1. Run the code (make sure Mu is on Microbit mode)

---

## Congratulations, you have now made a flashing external light using a Microbit and Python 3!
